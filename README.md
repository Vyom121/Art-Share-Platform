# Art-Share-Platform
It is a project made from django and it is a platform that will help artisians and artist to get recognized
In this a person can create a account and upload there pics as post which will be shown as a post in post feed.These posts can be liked by the people publicly and will help the people to come accross different forms of art from all over the world.
In my website people can like the arts of the user and even follow them so that and recent post from them will be shown to the following users.People can also customize their settings according to their needs. Some of the features are they can change their cover photo, profile picture and much more.
I have also created login page which allow only authenticated users to acces the website and for using the services you have to create account.
